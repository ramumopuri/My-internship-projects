In this data analysis project, we're going to conduct a very comprehensive case study on cybersecurity risks, specifically focusing on the vulnerabilities reported in the year 2022. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset obtained from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), we aim to gain insights into the nature of these vulnerabilities, the affected products, and their potential impact on the security landscape.

Cybersecurity threats have become increasingly sophisticated and prevalent in recent years. Organizations and individuals alike face the constant challenge of safeguarding their systems and data from malicious actors. Understanding the vulnerabilities that exist is crucial for developing effective defense strategies and mitigating potential risks.

Our dataset consists of detailed information about various vulnerabilities, including the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs, vendor and product details, vulnerability names, dates of discovery, severity ratings, and recommended actions. By analyzing this data, we can uncover patterns, trends, and key insights that shed light on the evolving cybersecurity landscape in 2022.

Throughout this analysis, we will employ the powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities of the R programming language. By applying various techniques and methodologies, ranging from Network, Clustering and Bayesian Analysis.
