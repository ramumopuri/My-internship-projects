A network vulnerability assessment reviews and analyzes an organization’s network infrastructure to find cybersecurity vulnerabilities and network security loopholes. The evaluation can be done manually or by using vulnerability analysis software. Software is preferred because it’s less susceptible to human error and delivers more accurate results.

A vulnerability assessment determines the strength of a company’s network security. Along the way, it uncovers any security vulnerabilities that might compromise the overall business operations, cybersecurity, compliance, and network privacy.

Vulnerability assessments should not be confused with penetration tests (also known as pen tests), which simulate a cyber attack. A penetration test does typically focuses on firewalls and their vulnerabilities, since those are the best ways to “crack” a secure network — but the simulated attacks of a pen test and the analysis of a vulnerability assessment are not the same thing.

It may help to think of a network vulnerability assessment as an inspection done from the inside, searching for and reporting vulnerabilities in your networks and operating systems. A penetration test is a mock cyberattack conducted from the outside to see how well your defenses work.

Many businesses conduct both pen tests and vulnerability assessments on an ongoing basis to comply with regulations. For example, this is true for credit card and payment processors that must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

What Is Network Vulnerability Management?
Vulnerability management involves identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting system vulnerabilities and software weaknesses to strengthen an organization’s security defenses. IT teams can prioritize threats and minimize their exposure to potential attacks by doing so.

Vulnerability management usually starts by systematically scanning and assessing an organization’s infrastructure for vulnerabilities. Once identified, professionals evaluate those vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact, prioritizing (and promptly addressing) the most critical vulnerabilities.

Treating vulnerabilities involves software patches, system reconfigurations, and security controls to mitigate the identified weaknesses. Additionally, clear reporting on the status of vulnerabilities and their remediation progress helps organizations to maintain visibility and make informed decisions.

What Are the 5 Steps of Vulnerability Management?
Experts typically rely on the following five-step approach to assure continuous monitoring and mitigate potential weaknesses.

Step 1: Assess
To assess vulnerabilities in your organization’s assets effectively, compile a comprehensive inventory including operating systems, cloud services, hardware, and software. Use specialized tools for automated vulnerability scans in cloud environments, and for legacy systems, opt for network-based solutions. You can also conduct isolated scans to assure thorough coverage across network sections.

Step 2: Prioritize
After obtaining the scan results, prioritize vulnerabilities based on their criticality and potential effect on your business. Classify assets according to importance, and assign a business value to each group. Evaluate the risk level associated with each asset, considering the business context to determine the priority for remediation efforts.

Step 3: Address
Take action to address identified vulnerabilities by implementing necessary updates, patches, and configurations. Examples include updating hardware or software, making secure configuration changes, or isolating vulnerable systems. Additionally, deactivate compromised user accounts, enhance employee training, and consider deploying automation technologies to streamline manual tasks.

Step 4: Re-scan
Scan your IT environment again after remediation, using the same method as Step 1. This will verify whether the actions taken have successfully resolved the identified vulnerabilities. If you discover any new issues, revisit the remediation process to address them promptly and assure comprehensive security coverage.

Step 5: Report
Maintain a detailed security log to track and document security issues, applied patches, and remediation efforts. This log is crucial for audits, compliance, and monitoring progress. By recording incidents and monitoring weaknesses, your team can continuously improve vulnerability management and enhance overall protection against potential threats.

What Risks Do Network Vulnerabilities Cause?
Network vulnerabilities are the entry point threat actors use to gain access to your internal network, so they pose a variety of risks to your organization. For example, network vulnerabilities can cause operational disruptions by preventing communication between departments or with customers.

Network vulnerabilities can also lead to data breaches, which significantly affect the reputation of your business and can bring hefty fines or litigation costs.
